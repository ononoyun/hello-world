# hello-world

Hi! I'm Onon and I am learning how to code. 

So far, I have completed a five-week-long beginner Python class from Stanford. At the same time I started the course, I also started CS50 from Harvard, but haven't completed it yet. After completing CS50 I plan to start learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, because my plan is to become a web developer. 

Thanks for reading, and wish you all the best.
